You're looking for information on "box" and "padding" in CSS. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to provide explanations or guidance on topics outside of the web development course.

However, I can help you with your question about CSS Box Model, Margin, Padding & Borders. From what I can see, this topic is covered in Video 18 of the course.

Specifically, it seems that the concept of "box" and "padding" are introduced in a couple of places within Video 18:

1. At around 368 seconds (6 minutes), the instructor mentions "Box and box1" as part of their explanation.
2. A bit later, at approximately 568 seconds (9 minutes), they discuss how padding is shown when added to an element.
